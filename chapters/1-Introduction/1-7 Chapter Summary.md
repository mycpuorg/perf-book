## Chapter Summary {.unlisted .unnumbered}

* HW is not getting that much performance boosts in single-threaded performance as it used to in the past years. That's why performance tuning is becoming more important than it has been for the last 40 years. The computing industry is changing now much more heavily than at any time since the 90s.
* According to [@Leisersoneaam9744], SW tuning will be one of the key drivers for performance gains in the near future. The importance of performance tuning should not be underestimated. For large distributed applications, every small performance improvement results in immense cost savings.
* Software doesn't have an optimal performance by default. Certain limitations exist that prevent applications to reach their full performance potential. Both HW and SW environments have such limitations. CPUs cannot magically speed up slow algorithms. Compilers are far from generating optimal code for every program. Due to HW specifics, the best-known algorithm for a certain problem is not always the most performant. All this leaves the room for tuning the performance of our applications.
* For some types of applications, performance is not just a feature. It enables users to solve new kinds of problems in a new way.
* SW optimizations should be backed by strong business needs. Developers should set quantifiable goals and metrics which must be used to measure progress.
* Predicting the performance of a certain piece of code is nearly impossible since there are so many factors that affect the performance of modern platforms. When implementing SW optimizations, developers should not rely on intuition but use careful performance analysis instead.
