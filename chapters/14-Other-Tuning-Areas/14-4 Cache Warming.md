## Cache Warming {#sec:CacheWarm}

Instruction and data caches, and the performance impact of each, were explained in [@sec:secFEOpt] and [@sec:secCacheFriendly], along with specific techniques to get the most benefit from each. However, in some application workloads, the portions of code that are most latency-sensitive are the least frequently executed. This results in the function blocks and associated data from aging out of the I-cache and D-cache after some time. Then, just when we need that critical piece of rarely executed code to execute, we take I-cache and D-cache miss penalties, which may exceed our target performance budget.

An example of such a workload might be a high-frequency trading application that continuously reads market data signals from the stock exchange and, once a favorable market signal is detected, sends a BUY order to the exchange. In the aforementioned workload, the code paths involved with reading the market data is most commonly executed, while the code paths for executing a BUY order is rarely executed. If we want our BUY order to reach the exchange as fast as possible and to take advantage of the favorable signal detected in the market data, then the last thing we want is to incur cache misses right at the moment we decide to execute that critical piece of code. This is where the technique of Cache Warming would be helpful.

Cache Warming involves periodically exercising the latency-sensitive code to keep it in the cache while ensuring it does not follow all the way through with any unwanted actions. Exercising the latency-sensitive code also "warms up" the D-cache by bringing latency-sensitive data into it. In fact, this technique is routinely employed for trading applications like the one described in [CppCon 2018 lightning talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzRxikGgaHI)[^4].
