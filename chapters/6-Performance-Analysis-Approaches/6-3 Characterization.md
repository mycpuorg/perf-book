## Workload Characterization {#sec:counting}

Workload characterization is a process of describing a workload by means of quantitative parameters and functions. Its goal is to define the behavior of the workload and its most important features. On a high level, an application can belong to one or many of the following types: interactive, database, network-based, parallel, etc. Different workloads can be characterized using different metrics and parameters to address a particular application domain.

In [@sec:TMA], we will closely look at Top-Down Microarchitecture Analysis (TMA) methodology, which attempts to characterize an application by putting it into one of 4 buckets: Front End Bound, Back End Bound, Retiring, and Bad Speculation. TMA uses Performance Monitoring Counters (PMC, see [@sec:PMC]) to collect the needed information and identify the inefficient use of CPU microarchitecture.

### Counting Performance Events

PMCs are a very important instrument of low-level performance analysis. They can provide unique information about the execution of our program. PMCs are generally used in two modes: "Counting" and "Sampling". Counting mode is used for workload characterization, while Sampling mode is used for finding hotspots, which we will discuss in [@sec:profiling]. The idea behind Counting is very simple: we want to count the number of certain performance events during the time our program was running. Figure @fig:Counting illustrates the process of counting performance events in the time perspective. 

![Counting performance events.](../../img/perf-analysis/CountingFlow.png){#fig:Counting width=90%}

The steps outlined in figure @fig:Counting roughly represent what a typical analysis tool will do to count performance events. This process is implemented in the `perf stat` tool, which can be used to count various HW events, like the number of instructions, cycles, cache-misses, etc. Below is the example of output from `perf stat`:

```bash
$ perf stat -- ./a.exe
 10580290629  cycles         #    3,677 GHz
  8067576938  instructions   #    0,76  insn per cycle
  3005772086  branches       # 1044,472 M/sec
   239298395  branch-misses  #    7,96% of all branches 
```

It is very informative to know this data. First of all, it allows us to quickly spot some anomalies like a high cache miss rate or poor IPC. But also, it might come in handy when you've just made code improvement and you want to validate performance gain. Looking at absolute numbers might help you justify or reject the code change.

\personal{I use `perf stat` as a simple benchmark wrapper. Since the overhead of counting events is minimal, I run almost all benchmarks automatically under `perf stat`. It serves me as a first step in performance investigation. Sometimes the anomalies can be spotted right away, which can save you some analysis time.}

### Manual performance counters collection

Modern CPUs have hundreds of countable performance events. It's very hard to remember all of them and their meanings. Understanding when to use a particular PMC is even harder. That is why generally, we don't recommend manually collecting specific PMCs unless you really know what you are doing. Instead, we recommend using tools like Intel Vtune Profiler that automate this process. Nevertheless, there are situations when you are interested in collecting specific PMC.

A complete list of performance events for all Intel CPU generations can be found in [@IntelSDM, Volume 3B, Chapter 19].[^1] Every event is encoded with `Event` and `Umask` hexadecimal values. Sometimes performance events can also be encoded with additional parameters, like `Cmask` and `Inv` and others. An example of encoding two performance events for the Intel Skylake microarchitecture is shown in the table {@tbl:perf_count}.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event  Umask Event Mask            Description
 Num.  Value Mnemonic              
------ ----- --------------------- ---------------------------------------
C0H     00H  INST_RETIRED.         Number of instructions at retirement. 
             ANY_P

C4H     00H  BR_INST_RETIRED.      Branch instructions that retired.
             ALL_BRANCHES                  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table: Example of encoding Skylake performance events. {#tbl:perf_count}

Linux `perf` provides mappings for commonly used performance counters. They can be accessed via pseudo names instead of specifying `Event` and `Umask` hexadecimal values. For example, `branches` is just a synonym for `BR_INST_RETIRED.ALL_BRANCHES` and will measure the same thing. List of available mapping names can be viewed with `perf list`:

```bash
$ perf list
  branches          [Hardware event]
  branch-misses     [Hardware event]
  bus-cycles        [Hardware event]
  cache-misses      [Hardware event]
  cycles            [Hardware event]
  instructions      [Hardware event]
  ref-cycles        [Hardware event]
```

However, Linux `perf` doesn't provide mappings for all performance counters for every CPU architecture. If the PMC you are looking for doesn't have a mapping, it can be collected with the following syntax:

```bash
$ perf stat -e cpu/event=0xc4,umask=0x0,name=BR_INST_RETIRED.ALL_BRANCHES/ -- ./a.exe
```

Also there are wrappers around Linux `perf` that can do the mapping, for example, [oprofile](https://oprofile.sourceforge.io/about/)[^2] and [ocperf.py](https://github.com/andikleen/pmu-tools/blob/master/ocperf.py)[^3]. Below is an example of their usage:

```bash
$ ocperf -e uops_retired ./a.exe
$ ocperf.py stat -e uops_retired.retire_slots -- ./a.exe
```

Performance counters are not available in every environment since accessing PMCs requires root access, which applications running in a virtualized environment typically do not have. For programs executing in a public cloud, running a PMU-based profiler directly in a guest container does not result in useful output if a virtual machine (VM) manager does not expose the PMU programming interfaces properly to a guest. Thus profilers based on CPU performance counters do not work well in a virtualized and cloud environment [@PMC_virtual]. Although the situation is improving. VmWareÂ® was one of the first VM managers to enable virtual CPU Performance Counters (vPMC). [^4] AWS EC2 cloud enabled PMCs for dedicated hosts. [^5]

### Multiplexing and scaling events {#sec:secMultiplex}

There are situations when we want to count many different events at the same time. But with only one counter, it's possible to count only one thing at a time. That's why PMUs have multiple counters in it (typically 4 per HW thread). Even then, the number of fixed and programmable counter is not always sufficient. Top-Down Analysis Methodology (TMA) requires collecting up to 100 different performance events in a single execution of a program. Obviously, CPUs don't have that many counters, and here is when multiplexing comes into play.

If there are more events than counters, the analysis tool uses time multiplexing to give each event a chance to access the monitoring hardware. Figure @fig:Multiplexing shows an example of multiplexing between 8 performance events with only 4 PMCs available.

<div id="fig:Multiplexing">

Multiplexing between 8 performance events with only 4 PMCs available.
</div>

With multiplexing, an event is not measured all the time, but rather only during some portion of it. At the end of the run, a profiling tool needs to scale the raw count based on total time enabled:
$$
final~count = raw~count * ( time~running / time~enabled )
$$
For example, say during profiling, we were able to measure some counter during five time intervals. Each measurement interval lasted 100ms (`time enabled`). The program running time was 1s (`time running`). The total number of events for this counter was measured as 10000 (`raw count`). So, we need to scale the `final count` by 2, which will be equal to 20000:
$$
final~count = 10000 * ( 1000ms / 500ms ) = 20000
$$
This provides an estimate of what the count would have been had the event been measured during the entire run. It is very important to understand that this is an estimate, not an actual count. Multiplexing and scaling can be used safely on steady workloads that execute the same code during long time intervals. On the opposite, if the program regularly jumps between different hotspots, there will be blind spots that can introduce errors during scaling. To avoid scaling, one can try to reduce the number of events to be not bigger than the number of physical PMCs available. However, this will require running the benchmark multiple times to measure all the counters one is interested in.
