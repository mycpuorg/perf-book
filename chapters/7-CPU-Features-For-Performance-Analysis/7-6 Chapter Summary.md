## Chapter Summary {.unlisted .unnumbered}

* Utilizing HW features for low-level tuning is recommended only once all high-level performance issues are fixed. Tuning poorly designed algorithms is a bad investment of a developer's time. Once all the major performance problems get eliminated, one can use CPU performance monitoring features to analyze and further tune their application. 
* Top-Down Microarchitecture Analysis (TMA) methodology is a very powerful technique for identifying ineffective usage of CPU microarchitecture by the program. It is a robust and formal methodology that is easy to use even for inexperienced developers. TMA is an iterative process that consists of multiple steps, including characterizing the workload and locating the exact place in the source code where the bottleneck occurs. We advise that TMA should be a starting point of analysis for every low-level tuning effort. TMA is available on Intel and AMD[^1] processors.
* Last Branch Record (LBR) mechanism continuously logs the most recent branch outcomes in parallel with executing the program, causing a minimal slowdown. It allows us to have a deep enough call stack for every sample we collect while profiling. Also, LBR helps identify hot branches, misprediction rates and allows for precise timing of machine code. LBR is supported on Intel and AMD processors.
* Processor Event-Based Sampling (PEBS) feature is another enhancement for profiling. It lowers the sampling overhead by automatically sampling multiple times to a dedicated buffer without interrupts. However, PEBS are more widely known for introducing "Precise Events", which allow pinpointing exact instruction that caused a particular performance event. The feature is supported on Intel processors. AMD CPUs have a similar feature called Instruction Based Sampling (IBS).
* Intel Processor Traces (PT) is a CPU feature that records the program execution by encoding packets in a highly compressed binary format that can be used to reconstruct execution flow with a timestamp on every instruction. PT has extensive coverage and relatively small overhead. Its main usages are postmortem analysis and finding the root cause(s) of performance glitches. Processors based on ARM architecture also have a tracing capability called [CoreSight](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/system-ip/coresight-debug-and-trace)[^2], but it is mostly used for debugging rather than for performance analysis.

Performance profilers leverage HW features presented in this chapter to enable many different types of analysis.
